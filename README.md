* Score system (or if you're reading this before release which I doubt then soon)
* Low ram usage (you guessed it no gui = low ram usage lol)
* Cross-platform compatible (as long as you compile it yourself lol)

<h4> How to play? </h4>

That's easy just download the executable from the latest release if you're on windows if you're on Mac or linux well...

---

<h4> Mac and Linux</h4>

you're sadly going to need to compile it yourself which should be easy assuming you have gcc and cmake installed  
first clone the repo open bash and write

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Nullskulls/MineSweeper"
```
then you're going to want to cd into said repo

<h5>or you have a better option, look up a YouTube tutorial I can barely compile my own app I'm not the best guide</h5>
